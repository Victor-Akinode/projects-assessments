###This repository is for projects for my third semester at AltSchool.

This project demonstrates how to set up a PostgreSQL database using Docker. It includes the creation of a new schema and table, and the loading of data from a CSV file into the Dockerized PostgreSQL instance. The Python script included connects to the database and executes a query to count the number of records in the specified table.

## Project Structure

- `postgres_docker_init/`
  - `data/`: Contains the CSV file to be loaded into the PostgreSQL table.
  - `infra_setup/`: Contains the SQL script to create the schema, table, and load data.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file to configure and run the PostgreSQL service.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
