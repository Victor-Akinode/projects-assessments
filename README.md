###This repository is for projects for my third semester at AltSchool.

This project demonstrates how to set up a PostgreSQL database using Docker. It includes the creation of a new schema and table, and the loading of data from a CSV file into the Dockerized PostgreSQL instance. The Python script included connects to the database and executes a query to count the number of records in the specified table.
